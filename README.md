# Machine learning technology for EEG-prognosis of opening of the blood-brain barrier and the activation of brainâ€™s drainage system during isoflurane anesthesia

## Description of included data
There are two examples of data used for training and data of two rats with isoblurane anestesia.
* The data of file "1 rat 1 before the opening BBB.csv" from 1800 sec to 3600 sec were used as data of normal behaviour marked as '0' during the training process
* The data of file "2 rat 1 after the opening BBB.csv" from 1800 sec to 3600 sec were used as data of opened BBB marked as '1' during the training process.

The application of trained ANN was provided for two next files of EEG recorded in rats with 1% and 4% isoflurane anesthesia.
* "Rat_1.6.csv"
* "Rat_2.4.csv"
